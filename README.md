# CPP-Final
### How to run

In order to run the program type

To run a random sandpile based on given parameters
* ./main.exe 1,1 

To run a sandpile from a predefined file

* ./main.exe data/sandpile_10x10_4.dat 



### Problems that we had while making the program:

Our first problem was fully grasping the information given to us, talking to you really helped us clear up some questions that we had. And reading more about the sandpile helped as well
Another issues that we had is we had a segementation fault, and through cout testing we found the segmentation fault to be in our try catch function, so we had to figure out
where the error lies.
